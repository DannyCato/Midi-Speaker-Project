This repository was created and added to during RIT's Swen-340 that acts as an intro to embedded development for Software Engineering BS Student the majority of the contents in this repository is boilerplate for the microcontroller. If you want to see my code, follow the path of SWEN-340/Core. Most of my code is within Src/Project but there are select ones available in homework and system.
